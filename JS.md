JS 

1. keypress vs keyup

    `keypress events` are fired `before` the `new character` is added to the value of the element (so the first keypress event is fired before the first character is added, while the value is still empty). 
    
    `keyup events` are fired after the character has been added.

2. numeric variable

    Char code :

    `48-57` equal to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

    `0` is Backspace(otherwise need refresh page on Firefox)

    `46` is dot
  
    && is AND , || is OR operator.
